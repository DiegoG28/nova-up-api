# API with Nest.js, TypeScript, and TypeORM

This is an API developed with Nest.js that uses TypeScript as the programming language and TypeORM as the ORM to interact with the database.

# API Documentation

This project is configured with Swagger, an open-source software framework that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services.

You can access the Swagger UI and the API documentation by navigating to the following URL path in your application:

```
http://locahost:3000/api

```

The Swagger UI provides an interactive documentation where you can explore all the endpoints, models and even try out the API directly from the browser.

## Configuration

Before running the application, make sure to configure the following environment variables:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_NAME=nova-up
```

These variables are necessary to establish the connection with the MySQL database.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.

2. Install the dependencies using Yarn:

```
yarn install
```

## Docker Execution

To facilitate the setup and execution of the environment, a `docker-compose.yml` file is provided.

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.

2. Run the following command to start the database services:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will create a Docker container for the MySQL database.

## Running the Application

You can now run the application in different modes:

```
Development mode:
yarn run start

Development mode with automatic restart:
yarn run start:dev

Production mode:
yarn run start:prod
```

You can now use the API in your local environment.
